    <p> The Life of Jerri </p>
    <p> As a college drop out and now college student again, I have had quite the educational journey after high school. First attending nmy first semester of college at The University of Nebraska - <span id = "Lincoln"> _________ </span>, then two more semesters at the University of Nebraska Omaha majoring in undecided throughout that time, I decided college wasn't for me & decided to take a different path January of 2020. </p>
    <p> I attended an online career school known as The QC Design school. Everything was online and I ended up taking five courses to get certified in, Interior Decor and Design, <span id = "Color Consulting"> ______________________________ </span>, Feng Shui, Home Staging, and Professional Organizing. 
        I completed my courses and am now certified for all of the above. </p>
    <p> It was a fantastic <span id="two year"> __________________ </span> experience with online education, but I didn't feel fulfilled in my career selection. Now I am attending Bellevue University in my fourth term majoring something that actually excites me for my future, <span id = "Graphic Design."> __________________.</span></p>
