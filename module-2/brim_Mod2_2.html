    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

    <p class="intro">My name is Jerri Brim and I am a 23 year old college student with quite the educational journey under my belt. I started off by graduating from Bellevue West high school and attending my first semester of college at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.
        After spending time on campus and realizing a big university was not for me, I transfered to the University of Nebraska at Omaha majoring in education but alas, that didn't feel like the right fit either. Once dropping out of UNO I started an online career school
        known as QC Design School where i got my certifications in interior decorating, color consulting, home staging, professional organizing, and feng shui. Once completing that I decided to go back to school for Graphic Design and now here I am!
    </p>

    <p>I have lived in Nebraska mt entire life, born in Lincoln and moved up to Bellevue when I was two. <span> After a wonderful 16 years in my childhood home my parents decided to buy a small acerage on the edge of Bellevue and Plattsmouth.</span> This home has truly beena dream for the
        entire family with my dad spending his days doing yard work, my mom lounging by the pool, and me busy with my studies up in my little getaway of a bedroom. When I am not doing my homework you can find me playing Hogwarts Legacy or journaling in one of my many notebooks.
    </p>

    <p>Other hobbies I have include binging true crime podcasts and playing with my pup Millie outside on beautiful sunny days and inside on the chillier ones. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends and wandering aimlessly around Goodwill and Target for our next big purchase.
        When I'm not doing any of those activities you can find me at work managing cell phone bills for large companies. 
    </p>

    <p>I plan on completing my schooling at Bellevue University in graphic design within the next few years. After gratuation I want to work for a design company to get further knowledge in the business world of it and get more work experience in the field. In the far future I plan on
        doing freelance work so I can attend to my other dreams of traveling and starting a small home farm.
